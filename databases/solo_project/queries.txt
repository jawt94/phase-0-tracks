1. There are lots of different kinds of joins. What are they? 
Join, Inner Join, Left Join, Right Join, Full Join

Join - basic clause to combine rows from 2+ tables based ona  common field between them
Inner- returns all rows from multiple tables where the join condition is met
Left Join- disply all data from left table regardless of whether there was a match or not
Right join: returns all rows from the right table, with the matching rows in the left table. The result is NULL in the left side where there is no match. 
Full Join- returns all rows from the left table and from the right table

Trial of left join: 
SELECT students.name, major.name
   ...> FROM students
   ...> LEFT JOIN major
   ...> ON students.id=major.id;
