# Git Definitions :relaxed:

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a system that basically records changes to files, documents, programs or even websites so that they can be retrieved later. It's useful as it provides an easily accessible database that collects all the revisions made, including the time stamp and name of the person who changed the details.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is basically a sub-section of a 'master' branch. I like to think of it as a tree where a main figure breaks into separate parts.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

Committing is basically a saving point for the project. I like to think of it as signing up for a task officially. A good commit message is detailed and states what was changed to the last commit.

* What is a merge conflict?

Merging is the act of integrating another branch into your current working branch. A merge conflict can occur if two people changed the same lines in that same file, or if one person decided to delete it while the other decided to modify it. Basically, a merge conflict occurs when Git cannot detemrine what is correct, marking the file as having a conflict.
